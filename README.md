Social Network analysis on the marvel Universe

The first thing implemented in this notebook was data cleaning, eliminating duplicates and characters that were not frequent in the Marvel universe to reduce the dataset and have a better focus. Then the properties of the graph, like degrees, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, avg path length, and diameter of model were calculated. Then a testing of network model was implemented so that it could be compared to the marvel universe original graph. Different communities were extracted and graphed and finally, an information difusion algorithm was tested to see how quickly information could spread in a network like the Marvel one, which resembles a real community network.
